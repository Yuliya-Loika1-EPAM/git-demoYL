Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people

Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the partyYeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
